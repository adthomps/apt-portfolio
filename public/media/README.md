# Public Media Folder

Organized media assets for the site. New assets should be added here instead of mixing with legacy folders.

Conventions:
- blogs-podcasts/: hero and promo images, audio thumbnails
- photography/: stills, drone, and video poster frames
- projects/uiux/: UI/UX project thumbnails (Figma, Lovable, etc.)
- coding/: screenshots or diagrams for coding projects
- testing/: diagrams and screenshots for testing docs

Notes:
- Use kebab-case filenames.
- Prefer optimized JPG/PNG and keep under ~200KB when possible.
- Reference with absolute paths like `/media/...`.
