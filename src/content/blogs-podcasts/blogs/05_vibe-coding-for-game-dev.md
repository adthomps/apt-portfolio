# Vibe Coding for Game Dev: AI-Enhanced RTS & Simulation Projects

> [!NOTE]
> Vibe coding turns game development into a creative sprint—combining AI-assisted code generation with live testing and iteration.

## Introduction

In this article, I break down how I used vibe coding to prototype a retro RTS inspired by Battletech, MechWarrior, and Command & Conquer. We’ll explore using Python or JavaScript for early builds, integrating AI to generate maps, missions, and dialogue, and leveraging tools like Cloudflare Workers for multiplayer logic. Whether for hobby projects or AI-enhanced commercial concepts, this workflow makes game dev more accessible and experimental than ever.

## Example: AI-Generated Map Script

```python
# Generate a random map for an RTS game
import random

def generate_map(size):
    return [[random.choice(['grass', 'water', 'mountain']) for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]

print(generate_map(8))
```

> [!TIP]
> Use AI or procedural generation to quickly create game maps, missions, and dialogue for rapid prototyping.

## Table: Game Dev Workflow Comparison

| Workflow      | Traditional Approach | Vibe Coding Approach         |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Prototyping  | Manual, slow        | AI-assisted, rapid           |
| Content      | Hand-crafted        | Dynamic, generated           |
| Testing      | After build         | Live, iterative              |
| Multiplayer  | Custom server code  | Edge compute (Cloudflare)    |

> [!WARNING]
> Always test AI-generated content for playability and balance before release.
