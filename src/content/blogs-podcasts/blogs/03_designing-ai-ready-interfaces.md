# Designing AI-Ready Interfaces with Visa Product Design System

> [!NOTE]
> This blog covers how to merge enterprise-grade design systems with AI-driven functionality in payment, support, and developer-facing tools.

## Introduction

The Visa Product Design System (VPDS) provides a robust foundation for building secure, accessible, and brand-consistent experiences. But when layered with AI-powered features—like predictive fraud insights, self-service customer support, or intelligent onboarding flows—the design challenge changes. This article covers integrating AI components into VPDS-driven interfaces, maintaining compliance and usability, and using real-world fintech scenarios to illustrate best practices. Expect actionable patterns for balancing innovation with the trust and clarity required in payments.

## Example: AI-Driven UI Component

```tsx
// Predictive Fraud Alert Banner
import { Alert } from 'vpds-ui';

<Alert type="warning" title="Potential Fraud Detected">
  Our AI system flagged this transaction for review. Please verify.
</Alert>
```

> [!TIP]
> Use clear, accessible alert components for AI-driven notifications. Always provide context and next steps.
