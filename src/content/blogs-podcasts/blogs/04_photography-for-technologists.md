# Photography for Technologists: Capturing Innovation

> [!NOTE]
> Developers and technologists often excel in photography because they naturally think in systems, patterns, and optimizations.

## Introduction

In this piece, I’ll share how I translate my experience in building structured, high-performance systems into visual storytelling. We’ll cover composition techniques with an analytical edge, using light and shadow for dynamic shots, leveraging metadata and automation in post-processing, and building a portfolio that reflects both creative and technical expertise. This is about merging art and logic into every frame.

## Example: Metadata Automation Script

```python
# Auto-tag images with EXIF metadata
import exiftool

def tag_images(folder):
  with exiftool.ExifTool() as et:
    for img in os.listdir(folder):
      et.execute(b"-Artist=Your Name", img.encode())
```

> [!TIP]
> Use automation scripts to batch-tag images and keep your portfolio organized.

## Table: Balancing Creativity & Precision

| Aspect         | Creative Approach      | Technical Approach      |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Composition    | Rule of thirds        | Grid overlays          |
| Lighting       | Mood, emotion         | Histogram, metering    |
| Editing        | Artistic filters      | Batch processing       |
| Portfolio      | Storytelling          | Metadata, structure    |

> [!WARNING]
> Don’t let automation override your creative decisions—always review your edits.
